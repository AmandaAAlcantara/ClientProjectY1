         The coast path runs adjacent to the Severn
         Estuary for a distance of approximately 6.3 miles
         which is generally flat. The majority of this
         section of path has been established on top
         of the sea defence, allowing easy walking and
         rewarding walkers with striking views over the
         estuary and the historic Gwent Levels landscape.
         Much of the coast path and many link paths
         around the reserve have been surfaced allowing
         access for less able users.
