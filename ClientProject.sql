church has medieval stone carvings, a full

from the 13th Century. Two of the six bells

some of the oldest working church bells in

passes through the village on its way to the sea.
Monkditch carries water from an upland stream
to the coast, preventing the fresh water from
flooding the levels. It was first documented in
the 13th Century and probably constructed by
the monks at Goldcliff.","https://www.google.com/maps?ll=51.543082,-2.9164&z=17&t=h&hl=en&gl=GB&mapclient=embed&cid=14312818024152439300");

Goldcliff was named after a limestone cliff,
about 60 feet high, that once rose over a
great bed of yellow mica that had a glittering
appearance in sunshine, especially to ships
passing in the Bristol Channel.
Goldcliff was an island until the sea wall was
built. In 1113AD the Norman Lord of Caerleon
granted the Benedictines a priory which was
built on the island of Goldcliff. The monks were
also given the surrounding land to farm though
they had to reclaim it from the sea – continuing
the work of the Romans.
Goldcliff has long been associated with the tidal
fishing of salmon, which may well have had its
origins with the Priory or even in Roman times.","Natural Resources Wales - 01633 292 982","https://www.google.com/maps/dir//Harvester,+Seven+Stiles+Ave,+Spytty+Rd,+Newport+NP19+4QR/@51.5739365,-3.0105499,13z/data=!4m18!1m8!3m7!1s0x4871e6656d0d9799:0xffd5f40b5531a5b5!2sHarvester!8m2!3d51.5739515!4d-2.9446868!15sCgtSZXN0YXVyYW50c1oNIgtyZXN0YXVyYW50c5IBEWZhbWlseV9yZXN0YXVyYW504AEA!16s%2Fg%2F11b6q6k8tc!4m8!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x4871e6656d0d9799:0xffd5f40b5531a5b5!2m2!1d-2.9446868!2d51.5739515!3e2?hl=en");
