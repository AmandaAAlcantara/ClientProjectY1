on the Gwent Levels. The village probably
originated late in the eleventh century; its
layout has hardly changed since.
The church, St Thomas the Apostle, is well
worth a visit. Among its unique features, the
church has medieval stone carvings, a full
immersion baptistery and its font originates
from the 13th Century. Two of the six bells
in the central tower date from the pre-reformation period and are thought to be
some of the oldest working church bells in
the country.");

“Monksditch” also known as “Goldcliff Pill”
passes through the village on its way to the sea.
Monkditch carries water from an upland stream
to the coast, preventing the fresh water from
flooding the levels. It was first documented in
the 13th Century and probably constructed by
the monks at Goldcliff. ");

a wonderful brightness’.
Goldcliff was named after a limestone cliff,
about 60 feet high, that once rose over a
great bed of yellow mica that had a glittering
appearance in sunshine, especially to ships
passing in the Bristol Channel.
Goldcliff was an island until the sea wall was
built. In 1113AD the Norman Lord of Caerleon
granted the Benedictines a priory which was
built on the island of Goldcliff. The monks were
also given the surrounding land to farm though
they had to reclaim it from the sea – continuing
the work of the Romans.
Goldcliff has long been associated with the tidal
fishing of salmon, which may well have had its
origins with the Priory or even in Roman times.","Natural Resources Wales - 01633 292 982");
